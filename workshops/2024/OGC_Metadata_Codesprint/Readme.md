# Developers are invited to the November 2024 OGC Metadata Code Sprint
## This hybrid event will explore current and developing metadata standards for geospatial resources, producing guidance on their use and application separately or in combination.

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) GeoDCAT SWG and MetaCat DWG invites developers to the 2024 OGC Metadata Code Sprint, to be held November 18-19, 2024. 
Registration is free and open to the public.

For registration details please see the [announcement](https://www.ogc.org/ogc-events/the-november-2024-ogc-metadata-code-sprint/)

To participate oin the OGC-Events Discord Server (https://discord.com/invite/3uyaZZuXr3).

This hybrid online and in-person Sprint will focus on standards related to creation, storage and exchange of metadata for geospatial information. 
The Sprint will be held at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia from November 18-19, 2024 and is sponsored by our host, AURIN. The venue will be the Anita B. Lawrence Centre, Lv4, room 4035 at University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The map is at https://www.learningenvironments.unsw.edu.au/physical-spaces/anita-b-lawrence-centre

Participation in the code sprint and pre-event webinar is free.

The Metadata Code Sprint will have primary focus on the following group of APIs and encodings:

* OGC GeoDCAT standard (under development)
  
* OGC API – Records candidate standard

* ISO 19115 metadata Standards (i.e., ISO 19115-1, ISO 19115-2, ISO 19115-3 and ISO 19115-4 JSON Encoding)

* Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC), which leverages the OGC API – Features Standard

* Other metadata standards, such as CDIF, EML, and Local Context may be included where the use of these have important implications on the utility of geospatial metadata.

OGC API – Records provides a way to browse or search a curated collection of records of geospatial resources, known as a catalog. A record makes a resource discoverable by providing summary information (e.g. metadata) about the geospatial resource.

ISO 19115 Standards define the schema required for describing geographic information and services by means of metadata. Of particular interest will be recent developments on JSON encodings provided by ISO 19115-4.

STAC provides a common structure for describing and cataloging spatiotemporal assets. A spatiotemporal asset is any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.

Particular focus will be placed on use of OGC modular “building blocks for location” that address both simple and the most complex use-cases.

During the virtual code sprint, there will be an opportunity for joint discussion with all participants on the goals and objectives of the event, as well as the final briefing of findings and opinions of the participants. However, the majority of the time will be spent in collaboration between participants in active coding.

Use Case are being collected at [Proposals and Use Cases](https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoDCAT-SWG/issues/17)

The Sprint will take place on GoToMeeting and Discord platforms from 8:00am to 6:30pm (Australian Eastern) each day from November 18-19, 2024.
